### The Game Project 3 – Game Character interaction

Now to add some proper interaction to your game.

1. Inspect the code [0 marks]

2. Create variables for interaction [1 marks]
	- Declare four variables: `isLeft`, `isRight`, `isFalling` and `isPlummeting`
	- Initialise each of them to `false`. These variables will be used to animate your game
	 character.

3. Implement left and right for keyPressed [1 marks]
	- Inside the function keyPressed write two if statements to make isLeft = true when the 'a' key is pressed and isRight = true when the 'd' key is pressed.
	- Test your conditional statements  using `console.log()` to see the values of isLeft and isRight
		- HINT: look up the difference between keyCode and key to help you decide which variable you need to use.

4. Implement left and right for keyReleased [1 marks]
	- Inside the function keyReleased write two if statements to make isLeft = false when the 'a' key is released and isRight = false when the 'd' key is released, 
	- Test your conditional statements using console.log() to see the values of isLeft and isRight

5. Add game character [1 marks]
	- Add your game character code from part 2 to this sketch.
	- You need to place each block of character code within the appropriate `if` statement so that when the character is animated the correct image will be drawn.

6. Make the game character move left and right [2 marks]
	- In the draw function add two if statements to make the character move left when isLeft is true and move right when isRight is true
	- Test that your character moves left, right, and stops correctly when the a and s keys are pressed and released.
        - HINT: you need to use the isLeft, isRight, and gameChar_x variables.

7. Make the game character jump [2 marks]
	- Add another if statement within keyPressed that checks when the 'w' key is pressed.
	- When 'w' is pressed subtract 100 from gameChar_y . This will make the character jump up in the air (don't worry about it falling just yet)

8. Add gravity [2 marks]
    - Now it's time to make our game character fall down to the ground again
    - Add an if statement within the draw function to detect when the character is  jumping above the ground. 
        - HINT: gameChar_y is less than floorPos_y when this is happening.
    - As the action of the if statement you should make the character fall towards the ground. 
    - Do this by incrementing gameChar_y
    - At the same time set isFalling to true so that the falling image of the character appears
    - Finally add an else action to your conditional statement which sets isFalling to false. This will stop the falling image from appearing when your character is touching the ground again

9. Prevent double jumps [1 marks]
    - Now adjust the code inside keyPressed tp prevent the character from jumping when it already in the air.
        - HINT: isFalling is useful here 

Help it's not working !
    - Okay this is not a time to hack your way out of the problem. 
    - Instead go back through the instructions one stage at a time and check that you've done exactly what each stage tells you to.
    - Try commenting out the code from the later stages and testing the earlier stages to make sure that they run correctly.


### The Game Project 3b �� Canyons and coins

Now we'll add some interactive elements to your game to give it some challenge.

1. Make a copy of your code from part 3a [0 marks]

2. Collectable item object [1 marks]
	- Copy and paste the collectable item code from part 2b.
	- Add a property `isFound` to the object and initialise it to `false`

3. Draw the collectable item [1 marks]
	- Add your collectable item code from part 2b to the `draw` function.
	- Adjust the properties of `collectable` to make the collectable item appear in a sensible place
	- Make sure the collectable is anchored correctly about its center
	- Write a conditional statement so that the collectable item is only drawn when `isFound` is `false`.

4. Collectable item interaction [2 marks]
	- Write an if statement in draw with a condition that is true when the character is in range of the item. 
		- HINT: the dist function is useful here.
	- When the condition is true, set the value of `isFound` in the collectable to true.
	- The result should be that when your character comes into contact with the collectable item it disappears.

5. Draw the canyon [1 marks]
	- Add your canyon code from part 2b to the `draw` function.
	- Adjust the properties of `canyon` to make the collectable item appear in a sensible place
	- Make sure the canyon is anchored correctly about its top left hand corner

6. Falling down the canyon [2 marks]
	- Write a conditional statement within `draw` to detect when the character is over the canyon. 
		- HINT: use gameChar_x and the > and < operators
	- When the condition is met, set `isPlummeting` to `true`.
	- Write another conditional statement within `draw` which detects when `isPlummeting` is `true`
	- When this condition is met, increment `gameChar_y` so that the game character falls more quickly
	- Test that your character falls down the canyon when they pass over it

7. Jumping over the canyon [1 marks]
	- We also want our game character to be able to jump over the canyon
	- Adjust the conditional statement which detects whether the game character is over the canyon so that it also requires the game character to be on the ground.
		HINT: use `gameChar_y` and the `>=` operator
	- Test that your character is able to jump over the canyon as well as fall down it

8. Freezing controls [2 marks]
	- Once our game charcater falls down a canyon there should be no escape for them
	- In keyPressed modify your conditional statements so that the character can no longer be moved once `isPlummeting` is true.
	- Test that your character can jump over the canyon and fall down it, but can't jump out of it.
